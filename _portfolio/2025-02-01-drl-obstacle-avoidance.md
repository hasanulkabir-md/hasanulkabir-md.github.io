Research project developing an intelligent obstacle avoidance system for autonomous
mobile robots using real-time video input.

- YOLO-based object detection for dynamic obstacles  
- DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO) for navigation policy learning  
- Implemented and evaluated in ROS + Gazebo under varied lighting and sensor noise
