This project develops an intelligent obstacle avoidance system for autonomous mobile robots using real-time video input. A YOLO-based object detector identifies dynamic obstacles, while deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, PPO) learn navigation policies in ROS and Gazebo. The framework focuses on robust, collision-free navigation under varying lighting, sensor noise, and motion conditions.
