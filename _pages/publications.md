# Research

My current research focuses on **video-based dynamic obstacle avoidance using deep reinforcement learning**.

I am building an end-to-end system that:

- Uses **YOLO** to detect and track dynamic obstacles from a monocular camera.  
- Trains deep RL policies (DQN / Double-DQN / PPO) in **ROS + Gazebo** to learn safe navigation.  
- Evaluates robustness under different lighting, noise, and motion conditions.
