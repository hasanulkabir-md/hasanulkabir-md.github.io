## Video-based Obstacle Avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)

This ongoing research focuses on developing an intelligent obstacle avoidance system for autonomous mobile robots using real-time video input.  
A **YOLO-based object detection** model is used to detect and classify dynamic obstacles, while **DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO)** learn navigation strategies through continuous interaction with the environment.

The system is developed and tested in **ROS** and **Gazebo**, allowing experiments under different lighting conditions, sensor noise, and motion dynamics.  
The goal is an end-to-end framework that tightly fuses **visual perception** and **decision-making** for safer and more robust autonomous navigation.
