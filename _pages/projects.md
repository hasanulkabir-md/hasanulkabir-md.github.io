Here is a selection of my main projects. More details are available on my GitHub and research pages.

## Video-Based Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning
A research project developing an intelligent obstacle-avoidance framework for autonomous mobile robots using real-time video input.

- YOLO-based object detection for dynamic obstacle recognition
- DRL algorithms (DQN, Double DQN, PPO) for adaptive navigation
- to-end integration of perception + policy learning
- Implemented in ROS and Gazebo with dynamic lighting, noise, and motion variations

[Code / details if available](https://github.com/hasanulkabir-md/dynamic_obstacle_avoidance)

## Multi-point Navigation for Intelligent Inspection Robots
Research project related to your published paper.

- Designs a navigation method to visit multiple waypoints efficiently  
- Implemented and tested in a simulated inspection robot platform  
- Co-authored a paper in *Journal of Computing & Electronic Information Management, 2024*

## Air Quality Prediction Using AE-STGCN (Attention-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal GCN)
An advanced deep learning model for forecasting air pollution levels in urban environments.

- Combines graph convolution + spatial-temporal attention
- Uses multiple data sources:
- pollutant measurements
- meteorological variables
- point-of-interest (POI) distributions
- Learns spatial–temporal significance dynamically
- Improves prediction accuracy and interpretability

## Kalman Filter for Motion Tracking
A robotics project showing how probabilistic filtering can produce smooth, reliable motion estimates from noisy sensors.

- constant-velocity motion model
- noisy position measurements

Keywords: Sensor Fusion, Robotics, Estimation Theory

## Bayesian Regression for Noisy Sensor Data
A probabilistic modeling approach to quantify uncertainty in real-world sensor predictions.
- Bayesian linear regression with predictive distributions + credible intervals.

Keywords: Bayesian Inference, Uncertainty Quantification

## CNN for Classifying Fashion-MNIST Images

A probabilistic modeling approach to quantify uncertainty in real-world sensor predictions.
- Custom CNN built in TensorFlow/Keras
- Dataset normalized and split into train/validation/test
- Training using Adam optimizer + Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Achieved 90.66% accuracy on test set

Keywords: Computer Vision, CNN, Image Classification
