I am a Master’s student in Computer Science &amp; Technology at **Nanjing Normal University (NJNU)**, China.  
My research focuses on **video-based dynamic obstacle avoidance using deep reinforcement learning** for autonomous robots.

This homepage serves as a brief introduction. Use the navigation bar above to see my projects, publications, and CV.

## Research interests

- Deep reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation  
- Computer vision and video-based perception (YOLO, detection & tracking)  
- Robotics, ROS/Gazebo simulation, intelligent inspection robots  

## Current work

- Integrating YOLO-based perception with DQN/Double-DQN/PPO policies in **ROS + Gazebo**  
- Studying robust collision-free navigation in dynamic environments
