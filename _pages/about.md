## About Me

I am a final-year Master’s student in **Computer Science and Technology** at  
**Nanjing Normal University (NJNU), Nanjing, China**. My research focuses on
**video-based dynamic obstacle avoidance using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** for autonomous robots.

This homepage gives a brief overview of my background, research interests, and recent activities.
You can find more details on the **[Projects](/projects/)** and **[Publications](/publications/)** pages.

Under the supervision of **Professor Xiaojun Qian**, I work at the intersection of:

- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Autonomous Systems**
- **Software Testing**

My research focuses on applying intelligent algorithms to solve real-world robotics challenges.  
Previously, I completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology** at **Henan Polytechnic University** in July 2021.

> 🔍 **I am actively looking for opportunities to pursue a PhD starting in Fall 2026,  
> with a focus on AI, multi-robot systems, or autonomous vehicles.**
