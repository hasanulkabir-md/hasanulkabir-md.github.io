I am a final-year Master’s student in **Computer Science and Technology** at  
**Nanjing Normal University (NJNU), Nanjing, China**.

My research centers on **video-based dynamic obstacle avoidance using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)** for autonomous robotic systems, with an emphasis on perception-driven decision-making in dynamic environments.

This site provides a concise overview of my academic background, research activities, and recent work.  
Detailed descriptions of my projects and publications are available on the **[Projects](/projects/)** and **[Publications](/publications/)** pages.

Under the supervision of **Professor Xiaojun Qian**, my work spans the following areas:

- **Artificial Intelligence**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Autonomous Systems**
- **Software Testing**

Previously, I completed my **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Technology** at **Henan Polytechnic University** in July 2021.

> 🔍 **I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2026, with a research focus on artificial intelligence, multi-robot systems, or autonomous vehicles.**
