Over the past few years, my interest in autonomous systems has evolved from simple curiosity to a focused research direction. What pushed me into this journey was an exciting encounter with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**—a field where agents learn through interaction, trial, and error, much like how humans learn from experience.

RL didn’t just introduce me to algorithms—it introduced me to a completely different way of thinking about intelligence, decision-making, and control. That shift in perspective changed the way I saw robotics, perception, and autonomy.

## 🌱 Early Curiosity: How Machines Learn

I was fascinated by questions like:

- How can a robot learn from its own mistakes?
- Why do autonomous cars make certain decisions?
- Can a machine be trained to navigate an unfamiliar environment?

Reinforcement Learning provided an elegant answer:
**reward-driven behavior shaping**.
