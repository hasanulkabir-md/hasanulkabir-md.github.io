This paper proposes an efficient multi-point navigation method for intelligent inspection robots,
focusing on path optimisation, task scheduling, and real-time interaction with the environment.
The approach improves navigation accuracy and reduces traversal time in complex inspection
scenarios, and was validated on an intelligent inspection robot platform.
