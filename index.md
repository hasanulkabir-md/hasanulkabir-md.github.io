I am a Master’s student in Computer Science &amp; Technology at **Nanjing Normal University (NJNU)**, China.  
My research focuses on **video-based dynamic obstacle avoidance using deep reinforcement learning** for autonomous mobile robots.

## Research Interests

- Deep reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation  
- Computer vision and video-based perception (YOLO, detection & tracking)  
- Robotics, ROS / Gazebo simulation, intelligent inspection robots  

## Current Work

I am developing an end-to-end framework that:

- Uses **YOLO** to detect and track dynamic obstacles from monocular video  
- Trains DRL policies (DQN / Double-DQN / PPO) in **ROS + Gazebo**  
- Evaluates robustness under different lighting, noise, and motion conditions
